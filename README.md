# EzChat

## What is this?

EzChat is a chat server/client/library created for fun, and meant for me to learn how to properly work with websockets and handle events in python.

## What did I learn in this project?

How I can easily create a websocket server in typescript, how I can handle events properly in python and I learned asyncio further.
